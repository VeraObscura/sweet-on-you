The airy chocolate sponge, that homemade cherry jam, the intricacies of that divine frosting alone! Just one bite took me back to my youth, to the days when my brothers and I would fight amongst ourselves to lick the spoon, when my mother would  make this particular cake to mark the first snowfall of winter. A chocolate cherry cake with almond buttercream frosting. Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know how much I liked it, I just had to have the whole cake! Though I fear for my waistline, I hope you'd be pleased to know you've found a loyal customer in me..- J.W",
